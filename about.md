    &nbsp; I am 21 years old information systems bachelor student (since 2016) at University of Vale of Jequitinhonha and Mucuri (I know it's a big name, so often we use just UFVJM to refer). <br> &nbsp; Now I am contributing through a scientific initiative along with
    <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leonardo_Lana_De_Carvalho"> Lana de Carvalho </a>
    in topics like Artificial Intelligence, Language Convergence, Symbolic communication learning, and Multi-Agents System. 
    <br> &nbsp;  I like work/study compilers, artificial intelligence, functional programming, formal verification and other topics of the science of computer. 
     <br>  &nbsp; Besides studying, I like *Vocaloid songs*, coffee, *eating shitfood*, animes, hang out with cool peoples... ...  <br>
